A documentation for users, administrators and developers.

The users will learn how to install and setup a demo list. The administrators will learn setting up a list and plugin configuration. The developers will learn what pt_extlist is about and how they can manipulate pt_extlist.

The users and administrators need the basic knowledge about programming.

What does it do?
================

This extension is intended to generate all sorts of lists. The data sources for the list can be a database or an extbase repository or anything you write a data-backend for (SOAP, CSV, XML, ...).

There are different steps you have to do if you want to set up a list. For a detailed example see section "Instruction".

Here are some screenshots to give you an impression of how it looks like.
